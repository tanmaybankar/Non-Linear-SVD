# Non-Linear-SVD
This is the code implemented for the Term Project of BITS-F464 Machine Learning. The paper is based on using a modified version of the existing SVD on deterministic non-linear time series data in the presence of minimal noise. This approach helps us to extract the features (coefficients) of the equation that drive the non-linear time series data. 
Accurate results were obtained.
